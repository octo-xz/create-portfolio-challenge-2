            <p>During this project I worked on an already built static website that utilized both HTML and CSS elements. For the project I worked to add accessibility features such as alt text for images as well as labeling content with more descriptive HTML tags that will also improve search engine optimization. The project was completed and successfully deployed April 27th, 2023.</p>
