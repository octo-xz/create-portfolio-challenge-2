# Creating a Dynamic Portfolio Website

## Description

This project utilizes both HTML and CSS elements to craft a dynamic and aesthetic portfolio webpage. This webpage is designed to display previous project works and deploys to one live site as well as coming soon pages. For the website project I linked it to this github page because you're already there on the webpage! 

## Installation

This project can be accessed through the repository on github <a href="https://github.com/octo-xz/create-portfolio-challenge-2">here</a>. You can either download the .zip file or copy the repository through an SSH key by clicking on the green button on the right that says "<> Code"

## Usage

This website can be used by potential clients to preview this developer's prior work and decide if they are a good fit for a role to fill. It can also be perused by fellow developers to get inspiration and an idea of the competition (its steep!)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I would like to thank all the Learning Assistants through Ask BCS who helped me through blocks(even when they were super basic) and I would also like to thank my tutor Dru for being so fun and making coding a great learning experience. I would also like to thank my instructor Robbert for his great lectures as well as all the TAs who are invaluable to the learning experience!

## License

This webiste using a basic MIT license.

## Features

This project features an interactive navigation bar and a hamburger menu that I made with the help of several different tutorials as well as looking up different psuedo selectors and classes. 
This webpage features the main content area with the latest projects on display. Finally there is the Contact Me section allowing me to get so many job offerings.
