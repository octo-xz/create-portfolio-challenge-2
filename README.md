# Creating a Dynamic Portfolio Website

## Description

This project utilizes both HTML and CSS elements to craft a dynamic and aesthetic portfolio webpage. This webpage is designed to display previous project works and deploys to one live site as well as coming soon pages. For the website project I linked it to this github page because you're already there on the webpage! 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

This project can be accessed through the repository on github <a href="https://github.com/octo-xz/create-portfolio-challenge-2">here</a>. You can either download the .zip file or copy the repository through an SSH key by clicking on the green button on the right that says "<> Code"

## Usage

This website can be used by potential clients to preview this developer's prior work and decide if they are a good fit for a role to fill. It can also be perused by fellow developers to get inspiration and an idea of the competition (its steep!)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
